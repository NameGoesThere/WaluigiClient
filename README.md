# WALUIGI CLIENT
 Waluigi Client is a fabulous solution to cheating in the popular NES title "Super Mario Bros." The client contains a lua script one can inject into their copy of the BizHawk emulator, found [here](https://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk).
 
## The Client GUI
 One might wonder, if this is truly the *superior* cheating client for "Super Mario Bros.", What does it's GUI look like?
 Well, my friend, using our state-of-the-art SHIT *(Super-Human Interesting Technology)* Technology that our researchers spent *at least* 5 minutes researching, we have designed the perfect GUI.
